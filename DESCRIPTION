Description: Download and read datasets from the Swiss National
     Science Foundation (SNF, FNS, SNSF; <https://snf.ch>).  The
     package is lightweight and without dependencies.  Downloaded
     data can optionally be cached, to avoid repeated downloads of
     the same files.  There are also utilities for comparing
     different versions of datasets, i.e. to report added, removed
     and changed entries.
